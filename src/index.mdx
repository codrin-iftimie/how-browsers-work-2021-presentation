- **The user interface**: this includes the address bar, back/forward button, bookmarking menu, etc. Every part of the browser display except the window where you see the requested page.
- **The browser engine**: marshals actions between the UI and the rendering engine.
- **The rendering engine**: responsible for displaying requested content. For example if the requested content is HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.
- **Networking**: for network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.
- **UI backend**: used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. This backend exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods.
- **JavaScript interpreter**: Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.
- **Data storage**: This is a persistence layer. The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies. Browsers also support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.

# The rendering engine

The responsibility of the rendering engine is well... Rendering of the requested contents on the browser screen.

By default the rendering engine can display HTML and XML documents and images. It can display other types of data via plug-ins or extension; for example, displaying PDF documents using a PDF viewer plug-in.
But in most of our cases it's just displaying HTML and images that are formatted using CSS.

<img src={renderingFlow} style={{ maxWidth: "1100px" }} />

# From HTML to content

<img src={webkitFlow} style={{ maxWidth: "1100px" }} />

# Caveats

 - The rendering engine is single threaded.
 - Almost everything, except network operations, happens in a single thread.
 - In Firefox and Safari this is the main thread of the browser.
 - In Chrome each tab represents one process that handles a single thread.
 - Network operations can be performed by several parallel threads. The number of parallel connections is limited (usually 2â€“6 connections).

---

# Caveats 2

 - Data fetching is throttled. Animations will suffer while data is being fetched
 - A higher number of DOM elements decreases browser performance
 - Adding a huge chunk of DOM will eventually block the browser render cycle
 - In CSS specificity takes a while to compute
 - Inline styles are not that optimal
 - Async is your friend and your worst enemy. Browsers get to breathe when you use any type of async which is good, they can do a render cycle, hence unblock the main "thread"

# WebAPI

As JS developers we interact with the browser using its WebAPIs.
